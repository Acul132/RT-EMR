## Project Summary
This project is a mock EMR (Electronic Medical Record) system that would be utilized by a hospital.
The project was created using ReactJS as the frontend framework, and ExpressJS as the backend API. 
We utilized an MVC architecture for the database collections, and other technologies like Elasticsearch in order to index and quickly search all patients.
